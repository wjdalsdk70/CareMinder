## Introduction

Welcome to the CareMinder Hospital Management System repository! This project is aimed at addressing the challenges faced by nursing staff in South Korea, where the demand for professional assistance often exceeds their capacity. CareMinder offers an innovative solution to streamline hospital operations and improve patient care.

## Problem Statement

In South Korea, there is a significant issue with overburdened nursing staff in hospitals. Although there are assistants who can perform simple tasks for patients, such as fetching water, getting bed linens, or helping patients get up, many patients believe that they need professional staff for everything. This misconception leads to professional nursing staff being overwhelmed with tasks that could be handled by assistants.

## Solution

**CareMinder** is designed to bridge this gap between patient needs and available resources. Our solution allows patients to report their issues and requests through a user-friendly mobile app. These reports are then evaluated by an AI system to determine whether the issue requires the attention of professional nursing staff or if an assistant can handle the task. By efficiently allocating tasks, CareMinder reduces the workload on nursing professionals and ensures that patients receive the appropriate level of care.

## Features

- User-friendly mobile app for patients to report issues.
- AI-driven evaluation of patient reports.
- Efficient task allocation to nursing professionals and assistants.
- Improved patient care and reduced stress on nursing staff.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: We have chosen to use **Android Studio** for the frontend. Android Studio offers excellent compatibility with various devices and is well-suited for testing and development thanks to the virtual machines (VMs) it provides. Additionally, our team has a wealth of experience with it.

- **Backend**: For the backend, we have opted for **Django**. Django is highly secure and provides all the features we need for the project.

- **Database**: We have selected **MySQL** for the database. Since we won't be dealing with an overly large amount of data, and the data model's relationships are crucial, MySQL is an ideal choice.
